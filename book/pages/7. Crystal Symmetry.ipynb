For example, the second order polarization may be written as a $3\\times 3 \\times 3$ tensor (think of it as a cube with side length 3) with 27 components.  In general, each of these components is necessary to completely describe the second order nonlinear interaction.

    "If the material has inversion symmetry, then $P_i$ must change sign if all the field components change sign (e.g. the displacement of the electron cloud is in exactly the opposite direction with the same magnitude).  But if both $E_j$ and $E_k$ change signs, then $P_i^{(2)}$ remains unchanged.  Therefore, all elements of $\\chi_{ijk}^{(2)}$ are zero.  This same argument applies all even orders of the polarization.\n",

    "Crystals can be categorized by their symmetry properties, which can be classified by their 32 possible point-symmetry classes.  A point-symmetry class specifies a certain sequance of rotations, reflections, and inversions that leave the crystal strucutre unchanged, and is an entire topic on its own.  As an example, consider a crystal for which the $x$ and $y$ directions are equivalent, but the $z$ direction is diffrent.  This means that if we rotate the crytal by 90 degrees around the z axis, it looks the same.   Such a crystal would have the same optical response for an applied electric field in the $x$ or $y$ direction, so the linear suceptibility $\\chi^{(1)}_{zx}$ would be the same as $\\chi^{(1)}_{zy}$.  Likewise, the second order susceptibility components $\\chi^{(2)}_{zyy}$ would be the same as $\\chi^{(2)}_{zxx}$, and $\\chi^{(2)}_{zxy}$ would be equal to $\\chi^{(2)}_{zyx}$.  By this process, we can understand which elements of a nonlinear susceptibility will be equal and/or nonzero by looking at its symmetry classification.  Crystallographers have identified 7 classes of crystals.\n",
