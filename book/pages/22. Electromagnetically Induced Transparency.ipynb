    "## Introduction to EIT\n",
    "\n",
    "Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is one of the more recently discovered a nonlinear optical phenomena. It is a nonlinear process that allows an otherwise opaque medium to become transparent.  Here is an energy level diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/BYUCamachoLab/nonlinear-optics/blob/main/book/images/EIT.png?raw=true\" width=\"600px\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "In EIT, we consider a 3-level atom in what is known as the the $\\Lambda$ configuration.  A weak signal beam at frequency $\\omega_s$ connects states $|1\\rangle$ to state $|2\\rangle$, and is strongly absorbed as a result.  However, when a strong coupling beam is applied that connects states $|2\\rangle$ to state $|3\\rangle$, the absorption of the signal beam vanishes!  How can this be?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what's going on, we need to calculate the polarization of the medium oscillating at $\\omega_s$.  The key insight is to realize that all odd orders of the susceptibility contribute, and each term can be represented as an energy level diagram in which an electron starts in state $|1\\rangle$ and ends up in state $|2\\rangle$.  The linear susceptibility $\\chi^{(1)}(\\omega_s)$ corresponds to a single-photon transition from. $|1\\rangle$ to $|2\\rangle$. The third order susceptibility corresponds to the electron being promoted from $|1\\rangle$ to $|2\\rangle$, transitioning from $|2\\rangle$ to state $|3\\rangle$ via stimulated emission, and then being promoted again up to state $|3\\rangle$.  This same process repeats and is responsible for all odd orders participating.  This extra coupling to state $|3\\rangle$ is what provides the transparency."
