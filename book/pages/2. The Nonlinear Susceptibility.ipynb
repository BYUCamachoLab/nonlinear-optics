    "We have already seen that the displacement of the electron cloud relative to the nucleus can be a nonlinear function of an applied electric field.  The most frequently used strategy to express this nonlinear relationship is writing down the resulting polarization of the atoms $\\mathbf{P}$ (which is proportional to the distance from equilibrium) as power series expansion of the external field $E(t)$ (which is proportion to the external force). Since the electric field can be a function of time, the polarization is also a function of time.\n",

The susceptibility has units of $(\\text{m}/\\text{V})^{n-1}$.\n",

Now what happens if we add an external *driving* force?  We'll also include some damping to account for the fact that the mass loses energy when it oscillates."
