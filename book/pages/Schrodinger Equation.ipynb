What we did not do was calculate the dynamics of the wavefunction itself.  Instead, througout the course we simply assumed there is some atomic polarization resulting from the displacing the charge distribution with an electric field.  We never actually *calculated* it though.   We just assumed we could expand it using a Taylor series and used measured values of the expansion from a table.  \n",
