Re-solve the differential equations using quartz instead of lithium niobate and plot the result.  Find initial values of the electric field for each wave that correspond to sum-frequency generation and difference frequency generation. How much larger does the field need to be in quartz than in lithium niobate to achieve the same response?\n",

When this happens, the electric field from the generated wave will always push atoms farther from equilibrium, increasing the amplitude of their motion.  This is analogous to a child on a swing.  If the parent pushes the child out of phase even a little bit, the eventually the pushes will be working to decrease the swing's amplitude rather than increase it.\n",

    "In some situations it is not possible to achive phase matching ($\\Delta k = 0)$ for a particular nonlinear process or material,  but there is a clever trick called quasi phase matching that can help.  There are experimental techniques to reverse the sign of the nonlinearity in non-centrosymmetric materials at regular intervals.  This corresponds to inverting the potential well of the nucleus-electron mass spring system, so that the restoring force is suddenly flipped.  If the material is flipped this way once every coherence length, then the polarization wave and electric field repeatedly slip out of phase for a coherence length, and then slip back into phase for a coherence length. The experiemental technique to accomplish this is called periodic poling.\n",
