    "A neutral atom contains an equal number of positive and negative charges.  The positve charges are protons in the nucleus of the atom, and the negative charges are electrons orbiting the nucleus.  In the absence of any external electromagnetic forces, the electrons orbit the nucleus in such a way that the center of charge of the electrons is at the same location as the center of charge of the nucleus.   In reality, quantum mechanics tells us that electrons and protons do not have fixed positions, but consist of quantum mechanical wavefunctions.  Protons, because of their higher mass, are much more localized than electrons, which form a \"cloud\" around the nucleus.\n",

    "When an external field is applied, the electrons and protons are pushed in opposite directions, leading to a dipole moment:\n",

If a materials has a high polarization, it has many atoms with dipole moments close to one another.\n",

    "In linear optics, the relative positions of the nucleus and the electron $r$ varies *linearly* with the strength of the electric field. If you apply a field twice as strong, the center of the electronic wavefunction moves twice as far away from the nucleus.

So any line plot through the origin of the field projected onto one direction should be an odd function. The Taylor series expansion of that field should therefore only contain odd powers of $r$, but our Taylor expansion clearly has *even* terms, so it can't be used to find the nonlinear forces acting on an electron oscillating about the origin.\n",
