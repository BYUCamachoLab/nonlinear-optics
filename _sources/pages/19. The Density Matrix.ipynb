    "Let's explore what this rate equation is telling us. We can think of it this way:  When the perturbation part of the Hamiltonion $V$ operates on the wavefunction $\\psi$, it modifies each of the stationary states that make up the \"bare\" wavefunctions.  Each of the bare states are now in a superposition of the other bare states, with $V_{nl}$ telling us how much of the state $|n\\rangle$ is mapped onto the state $|l \\rangle$ by the perturbation $V$. But the new state $|l\\rangle$ has a *different* time evolution $e^{-j\\omega_l t}$, so as the state evolves, the result of a small perturbation can actually result in a large re-mapping in the original state into the other stationary states over time.  Does this sound like what we've been studying in nonlinear optics?  I hope so!\n"
