    "# Stimulated Brillouin Scattering\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last two notebooks, we have studied the scattering of light by elastic waves.  In this section we continue that study by considering another acousto-optic process, Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS).  SBS is very similar to Stimulated Raman Scattering in that the optical wave itself drives an elastic vibration.  Historically, however, SBS has two distinct features that make it different from SRS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SBS involves low-frequency acoustic waves\n",
    "2. The stokes optical wave in SBS is normally observed in the backward direction\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to acousto-optic modulation, the SBS interaction is usually mediated by the electrostrictive effect.  In this notebook, we will write down a wave equation for the acoustic waves produced by SBS via electrostriction, and then use that coupled wave equation in addition to the familiear nonlinear ode's we have been studying to model SBS.\n"

A very small wavevector means a very small acoustic frequency since $\\Omega_A = K_A V$.  In order to maximize the gain, we would like to maximize the acoustic wave-vector (see below), but co-propogation minimizes $K_A$.  \n",
